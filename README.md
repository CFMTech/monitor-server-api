## Features

For short, monitor-server-api helps you to collect, historicize and exploit the data from your tests
written with pytest and monitored with pytest-monitor.

* Centralize your tests results
    * bring support for *pytest-xdist* and *pytest-parallel*
* Easy data querying through specific queries
* Integrated library for in-script queries

## Usage

The server can be launched easily with any WSGI Framework.
The following lines can be used for a start:

```bash
bash $> # Use it with sqlite (not recomended for production)
bash $> export DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/sqlite/db
bash $> uwsgi --http 0.0.0.0:8050 --workers 8 --process 8 --master 
--harakiri 60 --harakiri-verbose --need-app -w monitor_server_api.uwsgi 
--callable WSGI_SERVER --env DATABASE_PATH=${DATABASE_PATH} --env ENV=prod
```

If you prefer using conda
```bash
bash $> conda activate <your monitor-server-api env>
bash $> # Setup the server to listen on port 8080, 8 workers, 60s max per request and using sqlite
bash $> launch-monitor-server.sh -p 8080 -t 60 -w 8 -u sqlite:////path/to/db
```

You can validate that the server runs correctly by going to the root page of the server.
